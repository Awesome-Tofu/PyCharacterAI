# PyCharacterAI
> An unofficial asynchronous Python api wrapper for [Character AI](https://character.ai/) using [curl-cffi](https://github.com/yifeikong/curl_cffi).
##

This library is based on the [Character AI Unofficial Node API](https://github.com/realcoloride/node_characterai), made by [realcoloride](https://github.com/realcoloride).

---
## Installation
```bash
pip install PyCharacterAI
```
---


## Getting started
**First, import and create a new instance of the `Client` class**:
```Python
from PyCharacterAI import Client


client = Client()
```

>  You can use `client = Client(use_plus=True)` if you have character ai
>  plus.
---

**This library allows you to authenticate in two ways**:

\
*1. As a guest (Some api features are not available)*:

```Python
await client.authenticate_as_guest()
```
\
*2. Using a token*:
```Python
token = 'TOKEN'
await client.authenticate_with_token(token)
```
> Instructions for getting a token:
>
> 1. Open the Character AI website in your browser
> 2. Open the developer tools `F12` and go to the `Application` tab.
> 3. Go to the `Storage` section and click on `Local Storage`.
> 4. Look for the `char_token` key.
> 5. Copy `value`.
>
>
> ⚠️ Warning! Do not share this token with anyone!

## Examples
#### Simple example:
```Python
import asyncio
from PyCharacterAI import Client

token = "TOKEN"


async def main():
    client = Client()
    await client.authenticate_with_token(token)

    username = (await client.fetch_user())['user']['username']
    print(f'Authenticated as {username}')

    character_id = "iV5qb8ttzD7Ytl69U_-ONcW2tW_lrFrOVKExyKJHlJM"  # Lily (by @landon)
    chat = await client.create_or_continue_chat(character_id)

    while True:
        message = input(f'{username}: ')  # In: Hi!

        answer = await chat.send_message(message)
        print(f"{answer.src_character_name}: {answer.text}")  # Out: hello there! what kind of question you gonna ask me ? i'm here to assist you :)


asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Working with images:
> We'll get a link to the image on the Character AI server, which we can use for our own purposes: attach it to a message, download it, etc.

\
*1. We can generate an image from a prompt*:

```python
prompt = "Prompt"

url = await client.generate_image(prompt)
```
\
*2. We can upload our own image*:

```python
image = "URL or path to the image"

url = (await client.upload_image(image))['response']
```
> Available image formats: PNG, JPEG, WEBP.
>

---
#### Working with voice:
> We can synthesize audio from text using one of several voices (Text to Speech)

[A list of available voices](https://github.com/Xtr4F/PyCharacterAI/blob/main/docs/resources/voices.json)

```python
text = "Hi all ! This is PyCharacterAI. PyCharacterAI is An unofficial asynchronous api wrapper for Character AI. For Python."
voice = 22 # Anime Girl (F) (en-US)

audio = await client.generate_voice(voice, text)
```
>It'll return BytesIO, which we can use:
>
>```python
>filepath = "voice.mp3"  # Path to the directory where you want to save the audio
>
>with open(filepath, 'wb') as f:
>    f.write(audio.read())
>```
